Bootstrap Request Tracker
=========================

If you're like me, you've grown tired of the layout and styling of
[http://bestpractical.com/rt/](Request Tracker) (RT). This Greasemonkey script
attempts to reformat RT more to my liking.

If you have Greasemonkey installed already, click this link to add the script:

https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/bootstraped_request_tracker/raw/master/rt.user.js

After installation, edit the script and set the include line to whatever RT instance you need:

    // @include        http://rt.easter-eggs.org/demos/oldstable/*
